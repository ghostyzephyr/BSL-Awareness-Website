                <h2>Why this website exists.</h2>
                <p>In the early 1900's, pit bulls were given the title of "Nanny Dogs" and were the most loved dogs in
                    England and America. Given their loyal, faithful, and courageous personalities, especially when it
                    came to children. Around a century later, they are now seen as the most dangerous and are even
                    restricted to own in several states in American and multiple countries across the world.</p>
                <p>Lot's of people wonder why this is, and this is why this website exists. To not only educate, but
                    urging others to spread around the truth that this group of dogs aren't as dangerous as the public
                    deems to make out of the dog. This is website isn't here to persuade you to love pit bulls, but it
                    should make you think about the stigma that exists and how bad the distortion can be and to
                    furthermore, not judge breeds because of their stigma.</p>
