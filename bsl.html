                <h2>Now... What Exactly Is a Breed-Specific Legislation?</h2>
                <p>Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) is the umbrella term for laws that regulate or prohibit certain
                    breeds of dogs in order to reduce attacks by dogs on humans and other animals. The law may ban a
                    breed of dog completely or call for owners to adhere to regulations like licensing, muzzling and
                    insurance, or something in between. States like Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois,
                    Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas,
                    Utah, Virginia, and Washington have <span style="font-weight: bold;">Statewide BSL Bans</span>.
                    That's almost 50% of the United States. However, the problem of dangerous dogs is not solved by the
                    "quick fix" of breed-specific laws. Since there is no actual evidence that breed-specific laws make
                    communities safer for both humans and pets. Nor is it at all possible to decipher a "bite-rate" in
                    any canine.</p>
                <p>Breeds that are most affected by BSLs besides Pit Bulls (which are the highest ranking) include
                    Rottweilers, German Shepherds, Akitas, Mastiffs, Dobermans, Dalmatians, and even Chow-Chows.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>How Bad Is This Stigma Against Pit Bulls?</h2>
                <p>Pretty bad, no one really knows how bad until you really know the numbers. It not only discriminates
                    the dog but as well as the freedom of responsible owners of pit bulls. As most occurrences of dog
                    bite incidents occur because of mishandling from the owner, it feels of a case of one bad apple
                    spoiling the whole batch.</p>
                <p>It's also hard to think about that Pit Bull breeds make up around 6% of the whole dog population
                    (around 4.5 million), however are the most abused dog breeds in America, because of being forced to
                    participate in dog fights more than any other breed. And over 40% get euthanized in shelters each
                    year since adoption rates are significantly lower than any other breed.</p>
                <p>This isn't surprising that 25% of Americans view Pit Bulls negatively and 50% wouldn't recommend a
                    Pit Bull as a family dog. However when The Pet Alliance of Greater Orlando removed the dog breed
                    labels, over 64% of Pit Bulls were adopted. Proving that breed labels play a large part in the
                    adoption process, when it barely matters when it comes to generalizing characteristics of a dog.</p>
                <p>The stigma that should be on reckless owners, is on the victim; Pit Bulls. And has been for over 40
                    years.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>So What Can Work?</h2>
                <p>After a comprehensive study of human casualties from dog bites, the Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention (CDC) have decided to firmly oppose BSL. The CDC cited, among other things, the
                    inaccuracy of dog bite data and the difficulty in identifying dog breeds (especially mixed breed
                    dogs). Though it's been determined that it's the specific dog's history, behavior, weight and size,
                    the number of dogs involved, and the vulnerability of the person bitten that determines the
                    probability of biting and whether or not a dog will cause a critical bite injury. <span
                        style="text-decoration: underline;">Breed is not one of these categories</span>.</p>
                <p>Dog bite causalities is a more complex social issue, in which include <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">Breed-Neutral Legislations</span> in which are laws catered to all
                    dogs rather than specific breeds, such as increased availability to sterilization, holding owners
                    accountable for animal control laws, injuries and/or damage, and even unreasonable confinement. The
                    CDC claims that things like early socialization, training, and sterilization are also some factors
                    that can lower the chance of dog bite incidents occurring.</p>
